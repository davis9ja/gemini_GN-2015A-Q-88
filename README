DESCRIPTION:

This PyRAF script is strongly modeled after example code provided by the Gemini
Observatory. The data reduced are cross-dispersed, collected on two different
days (3 Jun 2015 and 2 Aug 2015) at Gemini North. The data are to be used in
order to classify the donor star in the x-ray binary system
CXO J174042.0-280724. The GNIRS instrument was used to collect those data, and
the K-band contains the near-infrared (NIR) spectral information required to
classify the donor star. Data were obtained from GNIRS with a 32 l/mm grating
and 0.3 arcsec slit at a central wavelength of 1.650 microns. Lamp flats were
collected using an infrared lamp and a quartz-halogen lamp. An Argon arc lamp
was used to calibrate wavelength as a function of pixel number. The GNIRS
short cross-dispersion (SXD) prism was used with the short blue camera
(0.15"/pix) and a slit length of 7", to cover the range of diffraction order 3
to 8 (corresponding to 0.85-2.5 microns). The spectral resolution of this
GNIRS configuration was about R~1800. Pinhole flats are used to trace the
spatial location of the spectra.

GOAL:

The purpose of this study is to classify the donor star in the known x-ray
variable and transient binary system CXO J174042.0-280724. Located near our
galaxy's center, the system is difficult to study in optical wavelengths
and shorter due to the density of dusty gas present within the galactic
disk. Therefore, the system is studied in the K band of the wavelength
range known as near-infrared (NIR). The K band roughly encompasses
wavelengths from 1.8 um to 2.5 um, but the interesting features used for
stellar classification are observed from about 1.95 um to 2.4 um.
Classification of the donor star is important because such information
will be constraints on interesting characteristics of the system, such as
mass of the accretor. The system is interesting because accretion is not well
understood, the x-ray variability is not well understood, and the transient
nature of the object is not well understood.
