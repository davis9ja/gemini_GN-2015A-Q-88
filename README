DESCRIPTION:

This PyRAF script is strongly modeled after example code provided by the Gemini
Observatory. The data reduced are cross-dispersed, collected on two different
days (3 Jun 2015 and 2 Aug 2015) at Gemini North. The data are to be used in
order to classify the donor star in the x-ray binary system
CXO J174042.0-280724. The GNIRS instrument was used to collect those data, and
the K-band contains the near-infrared (NIR) spectral information required to
classify the donor star. Data were obtained from GNIRS with a 32 l/mm grating
and 0.3 arcsec slit at a central wavelength of 1.650 microns. Lamp flats were
collected using an infrared lamp and a quartz-halogen lamp. An Argon arc lamp
was used to calibrate wavelength as a function of pixel number. The GNIRS
short cross-dispersion (SXD) prism was used with the short blue camera
(0.15"/pix) and a slit length of 7", to cover the range of diffraction order 3
to 8 (corresponding to 0.85-2.5 microns). The spectral resolution of this
GNIRS configuration was about R~1800.
